AUTHOR
       Most of Vim was made by Bram Moolenaar, with a lot of help from others.  See ":help credits" in Vim.
       Vim  is  based  on Stevie, worked on by: Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R. (Fred) Walter.  Although hardly any of the original
       code remains.

BUGS
       Probably.  See ":help todo" for a list of known problems.

       Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some, are in fact caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's be‚Äê
       haviour.   And  if  you  think  other  things  are  bugs  "because Vi does it differently", you should take a closer look at the
       vi_diff.txt file (or type :help vi_diff.txt when in Vim).  Also have a look at the 'compatible' and 'cpoptions' options.
