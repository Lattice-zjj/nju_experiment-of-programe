NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --force
              if  an  existing  destination  file  cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the -n
              option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit


       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.
       That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE
       file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is  specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.
       If this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may  be  selected
       via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)
       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the
       same name for an existing, regular file.
