NAME
     dash — command interpreter (shell)

SYNOPSIS
     dash [-aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [+aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [-o option_name] [+o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]
     dash -c [-aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [+aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [-o option_name] [+o option_name] command_string [command_name [argument ...]]
     dash -s [-aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [+aCefnuvxIimqVEbp] [-o option_name] [+o option_name] [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     dash is the standard command interpreter for the system.  The current version of dash is in the process of being changed to con‐
     form with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the shell.  This version has many features which make it appear similar
     in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX, plus a few
     Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this shell.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a complete speci‐
     fication of the shell.

   Overview
     The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other com‐
     mands.  It is the program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a user can select a different shell with the
     chsh(1) command).  The shell implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of
     features in addition to data storage, along with built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to
     aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use
     (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be exe‐
     cuted directly by the shell.
