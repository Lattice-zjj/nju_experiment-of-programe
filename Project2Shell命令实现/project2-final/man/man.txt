NAME
       man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the  system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or func‚Äê
       tion.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will
       direct  man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections
       following a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7" by default, unless overridden by the  SECTION
       directive in /etc/manpath.config), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional  section  names  include  NAME,  SYNOPSIS,  CONFIGURATION,  DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,
       ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.
